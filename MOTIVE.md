Yeah, we were building **TensorDB**, a **low-latency AI-first database** using Rust with JNI bindings for Java. Right now, you've successfully linked Rust and Java and executed basic tensor operations.  

### **üöÄ Next Steps for Low-Latency TensorDB**  
Since we're focusing on **low-latency AI storage & retrieval**, let's refine the core features:  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Implement High-Performance Data Storage**  
- Use **memory-mapped files (mmap)** for **instant data access**.  
- Optimize **read/write operations** using **Rust‚Äôs `tokio` or `rayon`** for async/multithreading.  
- Support **binary serialization (FlatBuffers, Protobuf, or custom format)** instead of JSON.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Fast Query Execution for AI Workloads**  
- Design a **fast indexing structure** (B+ Trees, Bloom filters, or custom).  
- Implement **vectorized operations** for querying tensors efficiently.  
- Enable **batch processing** to reduce query overhead.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ JNI Optimization & Java API**  
- Ensure **zero-copy data transfer** between Java & Rust.  
- Optimize **native method calls** to avoid unnecessary context switching.  
- Make a **Java-friendly API** with easy-to-use functions.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Persistence & Caching**  
- Implement **persistent tensor storage** to retrieve saved models instantly.  
- Add **LRU caching** to speed up repeated queries.  

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Benchmark & Optimize**  
- Compare **TensorDB vs. SQLite, LMDB, RocksDB** in AI workloads.  
- Optimize **Rust‚Äôs memory usage & garbage collection strategies**.

### **üî• Immediate Next Step: Implement a Simple Data Store**  
Let‚Äôs start with **storing tensors efficiently** in a Rust-based database. Do you want:  
1. **In-memory storage (fast, but non-persistent)**  
2. **Persistent storage (writes to disk, optimized for speed)**  

Which approach do you prefer? üöÄ
